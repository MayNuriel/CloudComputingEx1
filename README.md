The Task - Build a system that would track and compute cars entry & exit from parking lots, as well as compute their charge.
 

The system is deployed to AWS by: deploying on an EC2 instance (with the region us-east-1) as standard application.
The app is written in Python, using Flask.


The bash script which deploys the code to the cloud is: "setup.sh"
